## Disable intro in Space Engineers game

> [!WARNING]
> The bat-files are written and tested on Windows 10

### How does it work?
The bat-file will rename the intro video, which is why the game will stop showing it

> [!NOTE]
> After each update, the intro is restored when checking files
>
> Just run `disable-intro.bat` again

## Do it

1. Unzip these files to the root folder of the Space Engineers game
- `disable-intro.bat`
- `restore-intro.bat`
2. Run `disable-intro.bat`

> [!TIP]
> - `restore-intro.bat` If you need to turn on the intro again
> - Also, both bat-files will see when a duplicate video appears after updating the game and delete the extra copy
